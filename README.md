### Hi there 👋


🔭 I am working as a Backend Developer with Java and have developed many projects according to clients' needs.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Java 21
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Distributed Computing
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to Java, Grpc, Kafka, Spring and Cloud and its adjacent communities
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with continuous delivery, Spring , Java, English, etc.
- 💬 Ask me about  Spring and cloud native, reactive architectures, Kafka, Grpc
- 📫 How to reach me:  I'm on Twitter (@iamsinghankit_). That's the best way. There's also e-mail, though keep in mind I tend to be even more async in my replies   there...
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/they
